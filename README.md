## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install PyQt6 cryptography pyperclip
```

### Download and Run

1. Download all project files to a folder
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the application:

```bash
python "RUN ME.py"
```

## Usage

### Encrypting Files

1. Launch  File Locker
2. Drag and drop files into the application or use "Add Files" button
3. Enter a strong password in the password field
4. Click "Lock Selected Items"
5. Your original files will be encrypted and saved as `.locked` files
6. Original files are automatically deleted for security

### Decrypting Files

1. Select your `.locked` files using drag & drop or file browser
2. Enter the correct password used for encryption
3. Click "Unlock Selected Items"
4. Files are decrypted and restored to their original format
5. `.locked` files are automatically deleted after successful decryption

### Security Tips

- Use strong, unique passwords for encryption
- Remember your passwords - they cannot be recovered if lost
- Keep backups of important files before encryption (optional)
- The application includes password strength indicators to help create secure passwords

## File Behavior

- **Encryption**: `document.pdf` ‚Üí `document.pdf.locked` (original deleted)
- **Decryption**: `document.pdf.locked` ‚Üí `document.pdf` (.locked file deleted)

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher
- **RAM**: Minimum 512MB available memory
- **Storage**: Sufficient space for encrypted file copies during processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Missing Dependencies Error**
```bash
pip install --upgrade PyQt6 cryptography pyperclip
```

**Permission Errors**
- Run as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux/macOS) if needed
- Ensure write permissions in the target directory

**Password Issues**
- Passwords are case-sensitive
- Ensure no extra spaces before/after password
- Use the exact same password used for encryption
